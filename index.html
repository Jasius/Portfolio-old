			<h1 class="boxy"><a class="anchor" name="about">About me</a></h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is <b>Mindaugas Jasiulis</b>, I am student and self-taught web developer currently working on small projects and maintaining Reddit community forum on the side. I've had experience working with various experts in their particular fields and i've gained additional insight because of that which helped me to move forward quicker.</p>
			<p>Best experience for me as a junior web developer was on Reddit community forum <a href="https://windows10.reddit.com" target="_blank">/r/Windows10</a> simply due to its big audience which allowed me to see how effective color coding and animations are through various experiments, analytics data. I made its community interaction grow with the help of color coding and by vastly improving structure for community submitted content such as threads and comments, sidebar so content is easily distinguishable upon glancing over the page. Im happy that my work has reaches over <b>1 million unique users</b> every month on /r/Windows10 community alone while on /r/Olympics community during 2016 Olympic games my theme was seen by <b>3 million unique users</b> and during Olympic games that community forum was viewed <b>22 million times.</b> Pretty often i get emails, private messages on Reddit platform from users that like my designs are just hearth warming, those people drive me further to improve my skills and continue learning, trying new things. I've received some job offers from people that love my work on <a href="https://windows10.reddit.com" target="_blank">/r/Windows10</a> community forum and other communities. Thanks to this side project i've had plenty of interaction with Microsoft employees and feedback on subreddit design, write-ups about major build releases.
			<p>Apart from Web development related work i was involved in translating websites into Lithuanian and Russian languages, also contributed and started my own community write-ups about issues which are relevant to that community.</p>

			<h2>Windows 10 subreddit</h2>
			<div class="date">
				<p>2016 - Present</p>
			</div>
			<a href="/images/w10.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/w10.PNG" alt="Windows 10 community forum" class="img-responsive"></a>
			<p>I was invited to redesign this subreddit, I enjoy and use software that Microsoft makes and because of that i couldn't pass this oportunity to present my skills to such a large amount of people and i spent quite a bit of my free time discussing things on <a title="Windows 10 subreddit" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10" target="_blank">Windows 10 subreddit</a> anyways. My main goal on this community forum was to increase community interaction and come up with a way to highlight certain content which people enjoy. I've managed to do that by enforcing flairs system with a help of a automated bot and automatically highlighting threads based on their flairs so it's easier to distinguish content<i>(Threads were given distinctive background in the main page of the forum)</i></p>

			<h2>Bookie.GG</h2>

				<p>2014 - 2015</p>
			</div>
			<a href="/images/bookie.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/bookie.png" alt="Bookie.GG gambling site" class="img-responsive"></a>
			<p><b>Bookie.GG</b> was my first big project with a proper team which featured web developers, lawyer, designers, community manager. <b>Bookie.GG</b> is a gambling site in which you are able to bet Counter-Strike: Global Offensive weapon skins, which can be traded, sold. CS GO skins hold monetary value on the market. We collaborated with 1HP developers which also promoted our site and got us on board of CS:GO radio project. 1HP at the time was one of the most well known CS GO esport applications.</p>

			<h2>Regional park</h2>

				<p>2015</p>
			</div>
			<a href="/images/gamta.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/gamta.PNG" alt="Regional park site" class="img-responsive"></a>
			<p>This <b>prototype page</b> was originally made for my local Lithuanian regional park as an example of what i could make if they get funding for this project from European Union. Unfortunately local area regional park didn't receive funding from European Union for the website so they put their resources elsewhere instead of investing money into a website.</p>

			<h2>ClearShift</h2>
			<div class="date">
				<p>2015 - Present</p>
			</div>
			<a href="/images/clearshift.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/clearshift.PNG" alt="ClearShift site" class="img-responsive"></a>
			<p><b>ClearShift</b> is a site for promoting my third major version of my Reddit theme which I originally made for /r/MicrosoftBand community, I put a lot of hours into it, so I wanted to out source it and make it easy to customize, set up with pre-set code snippets so even people with little to no CSS knowledge can use <b>ClearShift</b> and customize it to their needs. Also broadening the reach of my <b>ClearShift</b> theme helps me to improve it even further due to feedback and bug reports. Also im using this site to promote other subreddits that use <b>ClearShift</b> so people can see how it looks in action.</p>
			<p>During 2016 Olympic games my theme was being used on /r/Olympics community so my theme was seen by <b>3 million unique users</b> and was <b>viewed 22 million times</b> during Olympics month.</p>

			<h2>DevBlog</h2>

				<p>2016</p>
			</div>
			<a href="/images/devblog.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/devblog.PNG" alt="Development blog site" class="img-responsive"></a>
			<p>I've made DevBlog site as FlexBox, Javascript local storage<i>(used for dark mode switch)</i> practice playground, another goal of it is to encourage myself to write about what im doing and why im doing certain things, this allows me to see how much i know and in the future by viewing my older articles i could see how my practices evolved, improved which is very rewarding. I've got inspired to do this by famous Designer <b>Tobias van Schneider.</b> I didn't set up any schedule for this project so ill do my write-ups whenever ill feel there's something interesting to write about and have some extra free time.</p>
